# Change management

## Changing project goals

Change management necessary if change needs any of these:

-   time
-   budget
-   quality

Changes during projects need to be documented and controlled. Otherwise, the costs and events trying to fix all issues are too high and too often.

It is very important to create a _cheat sheet_ which sums up all the information about the change on one single sheet. Moreover, the process of changes needs to be planned. Some _people_ need to _manage_ all the wishes of changes. If a change should be made, the _consequences_ need to be investigated deeply. Brainstorming helps to do this investigation. When all consequences are clear, the changes can be aborted or released. If extern customers are involved in the change, the must be informed continuously throughout the change. Only after the approval of this customer, the process can be started.

Summing up, these are necessary goods for change management of projects:

-   form (all information of change)
-   planning and documentation
-   investigation of consequences (Brainstorming)
-   people managing process and sorting out wishes
-   communication with customer

### Change request

#### What is a change request?

A document containing a call for an adjustment of a system. A change request is declarative, which means it states out what should be accomplished but not how it should be carried out.

Afterwards, the process needs to be specified more specificly. Folloing questions must be answered:

-   Who centralizes the request for change?
-   How does the decision-making process take place?

There have to be people who are authorized to decide about the change wishes. Moreover, all consequences need to be investigated.

#### What should be in a change request document?

In a change request there should be at least these information:

-   ID
-   customer ID
-   (maybe) priority
-   deadline
-   indication if required or optional
-   change type
-   change abstract

#### Who can make a change request?

Everybody how is authoriced to request a change infront of the customer.

The individuals who can make a change request may vary depending on the organization and the system in question. In general, a change request can be initiated by _anyone who identifies a need for a change_ in the system, such as users, customers, employees, or senior management. However, the specific rules and procedures for initiating a change request may be defined by the organization's change management process, which may require _certain approvals or authorizations_ before a change request can be submitted. Ultimately, the responsibility for managing change requests typically falls to the _organization's change management team_ or the individuals responsible for overseeing the system in question.

#### Source / reasons

-   problem reports that identify bugs that must be fixed, which forms the most common source
-   system enhancement requests from users
-   events in the development of other systems
-   changes in underlying structure and or standards (e.g. in software development this could be a new operating system)
-   demands from senior management
-   demands from customers
-   demands from employees

#### Why does a change request need a signature?

A change request needs a signature to ensure that the person who is making the request has the _necessary authority_ to do so. The signature also serves as a form of _agreement between the requester and the party responsible for implementing_ the change. It helps to establish accountability and provides a _record of who authorized_ the change. Additionally, the signature can help to _prevent unauthorized changes_ and ensure that changes are made in a _controlled_ and deliberate manner.

## Transform a company

3-5 years

Basically 3 steps:

1. Unfreeze employees
2. Actual change
3. Refreeze employees

Eight basic steps to achieve a transformation in a company:

1.  Establish a Sense of Urgency
2.  Forming a Powerful Guiding Coalition
3.  Creating a Vision
4.  Communicating the Vision
5.  Empowering Others to Act on the Vision
6.  Planning for and Creating Short-Term Wins
7.  Consolidating Improvement and Producing Still More Change
8.  Institutionalizing New Approaches

Every step is very important and the difficulties in all steps should not be underestimated. Even though, some steps feel useless or unnecessary, many companies failed during transformation because of underestimation.

First, it is important to convince some people that changes are necessary. The will of change often emerges of individuals. Bringing in negativ information from the world market and future problems, like competition, creates urgency, which is important for motivation of change. In the next step, this convinced group needs to form a powerful coalition which guids the process of transformation. In most cases, it is better if this coalition doesn't entirely consist of managers and leaders of the company. This risks breaking the built-up urgency. All change leaders need strong line leadership and the will of change. Next, the group needs to create a vision. This doesn't mean creating projects, processes, programs and other ways which should transform the company, but setting a goal, a vision. How should the company look like in 5-10 years? In order to motivate more than 75% of companies employees and employers, managers and customers, this vision needs to be spread out - clear and convincing -, then.

## Evolution vs. Revolution

Evolution is gradually, for example the parents watch their children grow but there is no sudden change. Revolution is a sudden change, for example the uncle sees the children after 8 months and wonders how they grow so fast.

## Will the change request succeed?

In order that the change request succeeds, these aspects has to function properly:

-   The authority needs to manage the change request fully and clearly. They need to be able to make quick and good decitions.
-   Clear description of the problem, which must be changed.
-   Alignment with business objectives: The change request should be aligned with the overall business objectives of the organization. It should be tied to specific goals, such as improving efficiency, increasing revenue, or enhancing customer satisfaction.
-   Feasibility and impact assessment: The change request should be assessed for feasibility and impact. This involves evaluating whether the change is technically possible, whether it can be implemented within the required time frame and budget, and what its impact will be on other systems, processes, and stakeholders.
-   Approval from relevant parties: The change request should be approved by the relevant parties, including stakeholders, sponsors, and project managers. This helps to ensure that the change is aligned with the overall strategy and goals of the organization, and that it has the necessary support and resources to be successful.
-   Change management and communication plan: The change request should be accompanied by a change management and communication plan. This plan should outline how the change will be managed, communicated, and implemented, and should include details on training, testing, and rollout.
