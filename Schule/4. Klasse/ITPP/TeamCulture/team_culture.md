# Team Culture

# Definition of team culture

Team culture refers to the values, norms, attitudes and behaviours that prevail in a particular team and influence the way members of the team work together and communicate. It also includes the way decisions are made and how conflicts are resolved within the team.

# Relationship between team culture, leadership, motivation, error behaviour and conflict

Team culture has a major impact on leadership, motivation, error behaviour and conflict within the team.

A positive team culture is based on trust, openness, respect and collaboration promotes effective leadership by increasing the commitment and loyalty of team members. These positive values also lead to higher motivation among team members as they feel valued and supported.

A positive team culture also contributes to a more open approach to mistakes. When mistakes are seen as an opportunity for improvement rather than a reason for punishment, a culture of openness and innovation is created. Conflict is also approached more positively when the team culture is based on cooperation and respect. Team members learn to resolve conflicts in a constructive way and use their differences to improve their work.
