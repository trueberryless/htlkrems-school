# Motivation

## General

Motivation is getting more important these days than ever before because the job is not just there to get by but to achieve living dreams. To achieve motivation in a job or whereever it is important to have a motive in mind. This means the drive and direction of human behaviour.

## different kinds of motivation

### intrinsic motivation

This is motivation which comes from yourself. It is either the curiosity or the standby to achieve / accept a challange. Therefore, it is the better way of achieving motivation.

Intrinsic motivation is rewarded by yourself.

### extrinsic motivation

Extrinsic motivation is not as affective as intrinsic motivation because it doesn't emerge from yourself's. This motivation arises from external incentives and influences. Therefore, it is more difficult to achieve more motivation with this approach than with the intrinsic motivation.

Extrinsic motivation is rewarded by someone else than yourlsef (e.g. your boss, wife, children, ...).

## neurobiology behind motivation

3 substances support the arise of motivation in our brain:

### 1. Dopamin

It makes you wanna work something. Nowadays it is often important to regulate the dopamin level (e.g. dopamin detox) in order to achieve motivation because for example social media consum leads to dopamin explotions in the brain. As a result, normal work gets boring because there isn't so much dopamin available (in contrast to using social media; particularly TikTok!).

Dopamin is a physical and psychological drive and natural motivation drug which is very important for functionality of the brain.

### 2. Opioide

They have positive effects on the sense of self, the emotional mood and the joy of life. They also reduce sensitivity to pain and strengthen the the immune system. Without Opioide you would like to work but you wouldn't enjoy it.

### 3. Oxytoxin

Oxytoxin is the cause as well as the effect of attachment experiences. That is, it is generated when there is a trust-building encounter, and it can stabilise bonds retroactively.

For example if you had a business conversation with a person that gives you trust, there will be much Oxytoxin in your brain.

### motivation system

To find or give interpersonal recognition, appreciation and attention, like social recognition, the experience of positive attention or love.

### Important factors in a relation or a project

1. seeing and being seen (e.g. paying attention to the employee as a person),
2. joint attention to something third (e.g. an idea of the employee),
3. emotional resonance (e.g. compassion in the case of negative experiences),
4. joint action (e.g. helping out or doing things together)
5. mutual understanding of motives and intentions (e.g. recognising the motives of employees and thus developing potential)

-   reciprocity / mutuality or complementarity (engage with him or her)

"Permanent understanders" are so preoccupied with the other person that they are only considerate. "Self-specialists" on the other hand, are incapable of seeing the other and to understand others. One-track relationship arrangements must - whether at work or in private life - fail in the long run.

On the one hand, it is important to perceive and understand employees and colleagues, to recognise their achievements and to treat them fairly. On the other hand, it is important to stand up for one's own position, not to release employees and colleagues from their co-responsibility for shaping good relationships, to recognise and address conflicts and to show leadership.

## Categorize Sections in motivation

### School

Primarily extrinsic motivation because teacher tell you what to do and you have to do that. If you can achieve intrinsic motivation at school it is probably because you have understood that everything you learned cannot be taken away from you anymore and you do school for yourself not anyone else...

### Private Life

99% intrinsic motivation, for example Schneider IT (my own project since 2020) -> nobody tells me what to do...

### Family

no motivation really... (not yet)

### Friends

A balance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation.
