<p>A chart is a graphical representation of data. It can represent tabular numeric data, functions or some
kinds of qualitative structures. Different chart types can be used to depict the information given. Which
type should be used depends on the given information.</p>
<p>SiOUX does not provide an own charting library, but only the style for the following existing charting libraries:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.highcharts.com/" target="_blank">Highcharts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://echarts.apache.org/en/index.html" target="_blank">ECHARTS</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chart-types">Chart Types</h3>
<p>SiOUX currently supports the following chart types:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Chart</th>
<th>Use</th>
<th>Highcharts</th>
<th>ECHARTS</th>

<section hidden="hidden" id="panel-details" role="tabpanel">
<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="details">Details</h2>
<p>For SiOUX charts the following basic elements have been defined:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../pics/charts-dark-theme.png" title="Basic elements in the dark theme" /> <img alt="alt text" src="../pics/charts-light-theme.png" title="Basic elements in the light theme" /></p>
<h3 id="chart-title">Chart title</h3>
<h4 id="definition">Definition</h4>
<p>Each chart has a clearly descriptive title. Its function is to introduce into the topic at a glance.</p>
<h4 id="solution-specification">Solution Specification</h4>
<p>Do not use abbreviations within a charts title. An exception could be if they are commonly used by the target group of the particular application.</p>
<h3 id="axes-and-cells">Axes and Cells</h3>
<h4 id="definition_1">Definition</h4>
<p>The X axis (horizontal axis) and the Y axis (vertical axis) build together the main structure of a chart. There
are labels at both axes which designate the scale of measurement or group of objects represented by the axis.
By drawing horizontal/vertical lines from the several labels a grid is generated which consists of cells.
The grid makes the structure more clearly-arranged.</p>
<h4 id="solution-specification_1">Solution Specification</h4>
<ul>
<li>Provide at least two axes along with a scale<ul>
<li>X axis (the scale is placed at the bottom and is incremented from left to right)</li>
<li>Y axis (the scale is placed on the right hand side and is incremented from bottom to top)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Label the marker points along each axis; they need to form the point of origin for chart lines running
  perpendicular to the axis.</li>
<li>These chart lines define the chart cells, thus they are forming the matrix within the value indicators are
  plotted. The size of the cells depends on the intervals at which markers are placed on the X and Y axes.</li>
<li>Optionally a second Y axis can be included at the right of the chart with a different scale compared to the
  first Y axis.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="labels">Labels</h3>
<h4 id="defintion">Defintion</h4>
<p>After reading the chart title the viewer takes a look at the labelling of the axes. The axes are labeled with axis
labels as well as marker point labels. Both are the basis for the understanding the chart's message.</p>
<h4 id="solution-specification_2">Solution Specification</h4>
<ul>
<li>Attach all labels to the outside edge of each axis of a chart.</li>
<li>Write labels in sentence-style, i.e. only the first letter on the first word of a label is capitalized; all
  other words are written in lower case, except for proper names and recognized abbreviations.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="value-indicators">Value Indicators</h3>
<h4 id="defintion_1">Defintion</h4>
<p>Value indicators are the graphical elements, in the form of lines, bars, areas, series of dots or vectors that
plot the actual values recorded within the structure of a chart.</p>
<h4 id="solution-specification_3">Solution Specification</h4>
<ul>
<li>Determine the type of the chart on the basis of the form (or combination of forms) of value indicator used in
  a chart.</li>
<li>Differentiate value indicators applying to different objects within one chart by color.</li>
<li>Layer the value indicators one over the other from front to back in the order in which they are listed in the
  legend in charts with multiple value indicators (e.g. lines) that intersect at various points.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="legend">Legend</h3>
<h4 id="definition_2">Definition</h4>
<p>Charts containing more than one value indicator (line, bar, area, series of dots) are provided with a legend
explaining what is signified by each value indicator. The purpose of the legend is</p>
<ul>
<li>To explain to users how the various value indicators are visually differentiated.</li>
<li>To specify what data is represented by each value indicator.</li>
<li>To give users the possibility of showing/hiding individual value indicators (if appropriate).</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="solution-specification_4">Solution Specification</h4>
<ul>
<li>Place the legend<ul>
<li>if possible to the bottom of the chart. The legend items must be center aligned.</li>
<li>to the right of the chart (top line aligned with the top of the chart), with each legend item on a seperate row.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tooltips">Tooltips</h3>
<h4 id="definition_3">Definition</h4>
<p>Tooltips in charts contain explantory information on an individual  or multiple value indicators. They appear
when the mouse pointer is moved over the value indicator, and disappears when the mouse pointer is moved to
a different position.</p>
<h4 id="solution-specification_5">Solution Specification</h4>
<p>If a chart contains several value indicators and which all have a value within the same time range the tooltip
must be shared to provide a better readability:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../pics/chart-shared-tooltip-dark.png" title="Shared tooltip  in the dark theme" />
