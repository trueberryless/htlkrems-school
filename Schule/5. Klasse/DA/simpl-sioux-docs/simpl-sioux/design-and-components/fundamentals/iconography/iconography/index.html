<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="general">General</h2>
<p>Icons are graphical symbols that represent objects, functions and processes in a pictorial manner. Icons are
shown directly on the screen background and are very economic and powerful tools as they avoid localization of
screens and support a fast orientation on the screen. Each icon has a unique appearance and meaning. Consistent
use of icons enables an efficient user interaction.</p>
<h2 id="there-are-different-catogories-of-icons">There are different catogories of icons</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Standard icons</strong> (file, view, edit, open, search...)</li>
<li><strong>Engineering icons</strong> without domain-specific context (power flow, economic dispatching)</li>
<li><strong>Symbols and graphical display elements for dynamic process states</strong> (e.g. breakers and transformers in graphical representations of energy networks)</li>
<li><strong>Application icons</strong> for application header and desktop symbols</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p><strong>Icons are used to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Enable worldwide compatibility: no translation is necessary</li>
<li>Support the users' orientation: provide a fast overview about available functions</li>
<li>Reduce learning efforts: once the users have understood the meaning of an icon they can apply it to other contexts</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Something to consider:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Users rely on secondary cues (color, shape etc.) to distinguish groupings and locate relevant information quickly
  and easily.</li>
<li>Icons are better preattentive features than colors: users are faster in detecting indicators / locating an
  item when icons are used instead of color. The reason might be that color is more ambiguous than an icon;
  users have to infer that red means a decrease, which may take slightly longer than to grasp the meaning of
  an upward arrow.</li>
<li>However the best user performance can be achieved by combining unique icons with color. Using only one method
  of  differentiating items, lessens the likelihood to notice small differences (e.g. color blind people).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong> <em>Consider data-ink-ratio (figures) and signal-to-noise-ratio</em></p>
<h2 id="rules-to-be-followed">Rules to be followed</h2>
<ul>
<li>Do not design icons on your own.</li>
<li>Do not copy icons from the internet or other sources as this will have legal consequences for Siemens.</li>
<li>You can either use the Google material icons which are available in different format as well as web font or
  you can use the icons which are provided together with SiOUX.</li>
<li>An overview about the icons which have been created specifically for SiOUX can be found on the SiMPL Icons page
  below the following link:
 <a href="https://simpl.code.siemens.io/simpl-icon-demo/#/sioux/icons">https://simpl.code.siemens.io/simpl-icon-demo/#/sioux/icons</a></li>
<li>Here you can find all icons sorted by available categories including different tags. A search, a direct copy and
  the possibility to download the complete set is available.</li>
<li>Additionally all SiOUX icons are provided as easy to use web font.</li>
<li>An instruction how to use the icons can be found on the icons details tab.</li>
<li>If no icon is suitable for the specific application case, request an adequate icon from your usability engineer.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-find-an-appropriate-icon">How to find an appropriate icon</h2>
<p><strong>Before using an icon from the Google Material Design or the SiMPL icons web page in your project, you need to check your choice with the Usability Engineer in order to:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>maintain a consistent icon use within the project</li>
<li>maintain a consistent icon use with regard to other SI applications</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="how-to-request-a-new-icon">How to request a new Icon</h2>
<p>In case that no appropriate icon could be found, the icon design process has to be initiated by the developer.
To start this process the developer needs to provide the completed <a href="../iconrequesttemplate.docx">
icon request template </a> to your usability engineer. The usability engineer authorizes and coordinates the
icon design and will ensure that the new icon is accessible via Git.</p>
<h3 id="which-icon-is-needed">Which icon is needed</h3>
<p>The necessary information for icon design is derived by developers. They may be supported by the usability engineer.</p>
<p>All icons must be comprehensible and easy for users to learn and recognize. To reach that goal, the
functionality represented by the icon needs to be analyzed and understood very well. That also contains
information about the context in which the icon is used and, related functionalities. Take your time for
analyzing the icon’s function.The fact that icons consist only of a few pixels, does not mean that it is little
effort to design them properly.The following questions cover the most important aspects to understand the icon’s functionality. Without answers to these questions, icon design is not possible.</p>
<h3 id="context">Context</h3>
<ul>
<li>For which product is the icon needed?</li>
<li>Who will use the icon? E.g., a specific user role</li>
<li>When will it be used? E.g., the icon’s function is part of a typical workflow.</li>
<li>On which background will the icon be shown (provide a screenshot)?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="functionality-symbols">Functionality &amp; Symbols</h3>
<ul>
<li>What kind of icon is needed?</li>
<li>Which kind of functionality does the icon represent?</li>
<li>Is the icon clickable? If so, what happens when it is clicked?</li>
<li>Which metaphor can be used to represent the icon’s functionality (for example, a disk for save)? Do the users
associate a certain symbol with that function? Is there a standardized symbol for that function?</li>
<li>What are related but excluded functions (what should the icon not stand for)?</li>
<li>For the redesign of icons: What does the current icon represent? Why is the current icon not appropriate?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="graphic-style">Graphic Style</h3>
<ul>
<li>Are there any specific color requirements? E.g., the real-life object to be represented has a characteristic color.</li>
<li>Are there any restrictions concerning color depth or transparency?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="which-effort-needs-to-be-considered">Which effort needs to be considered</h3>
<p>The effort for icon design must be included in the project plan. A rough estimation for creating a new icon is 4 hours. This effort includes the following tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>analysis of the icon</li>
<li>definition of an appropriate symbol which is in line with the DG icon language</li>
<li>visual design according to the DG icon style and project requirements (color depth etc.)</li>
<li>internal reviews</li>
<li>rework of the symbol</li>
</ul>
<p>Do not underestimate the effort for icon design. Especially the small size of icons makes it difficult to represent a complex functionality in a meaningful and recognizable way.</p>

<h2 id="getting-an-overview-about-the-available-google-material-icons">Getting an Overview About the Available Google Material Icons</h2>
<p>An overview about the available icons can be found in the following link: <br>
<a href="https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline">https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline</a></p>
<p>The icons can be filtered by name, category and theme.
For SiOUX the icons must use the theme "filled". The icons are provided as .svg or .png in diverse sizes (18dp, 24dp, 36dp, 48dp, iOS and Android).</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-google-material-icons">How to Use Google Material Icons</h2>
<p>In order to use the Google Material Icons you need to follow the description of Material Icons Guide: <br>
<a href="https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/">https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/</a></p>
<p>For Web applications especially the description "Icon font for the web" is of relevance. Here you can find all
information you need to integrate the icons as WOFF/WOFF2 into your application which facilitates the handling
of the icons as the color and size can be set similar to the usage of a normal font.</p>
<h2 id="getting-an-overview-about-the-simpl-sioux-icons">Getting an Overview About the SiMPL SiOUX Icons</h2>
<p>SiMPL SiOUX provides a demo web page where all available icons are listed: <br>
<a href="https://simpl.code.siemens.io/simpl-icon-demo/#/sioux/icons">https://simpl.code.siemens.io/simpl-icon-demo/#/sioux/icons</a></p>
<p>The icons are sorted by category and additionally tags are supplied which are used to filter the list of
available icons in addition to its name. When clicking on any icon, the icon gets copied. Additionally
it is possible to download the complete set of icons as .tgz.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-simpl-sioux-icons">How to Use SiMPL SiOUX Icons</h2>
