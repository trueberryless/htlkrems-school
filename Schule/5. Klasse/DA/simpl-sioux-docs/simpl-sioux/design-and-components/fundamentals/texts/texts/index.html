<section hidden="hidden" id="panel-title-case-and-sentence-style" role="tabpanel">
<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="title-case-and-sentence-style">Title Case and Sentence Style</h2>
<p>In SiOUX according to American documentation headlines and titles in English language follow the so called Title Case while for all other user interface texts sentence style is used. <br>
The reason for this is that the correct capitalization ensures the readability.
The capitalization of the words visually separates the headline from the other content,
which helps the reader to know where an article (or a section of it) begins.
Additionally the uppercased wording alerts the reader to the premise of the piece, which can be especially important when readers skim.</p>
<h2 id="title-case">Title Case</h2>
<p>In Title, all the <strong>major words</strong> of the title are capitalized.
The following words are always lowercase in titles except when they are the first or last word: the, a, an, but, for, or, nor, to, and as.
In general, do not capitalize prepositions or phrasal prepositions in titles.
For example: Headline case is applied in this headline. <em>“Affordable Housing Development Stymied by Regulations.”</em></p>
<h3 id="usage-of-title-case-in-other-languages">Usage of Title Case in Other Languages</h3>
<p>In German and other languages there are no extra rules for capitalization of titles. This means: Titles are capitalized exactly according to the same rules as any other German text.</p>
<h2 id="sentence-style">Sentence-style</h2>
<p>In sentence style, only the <strong>first word</strong> of the title is capitalized, and all proper names. The sentence style follows the same rules as you would use for writing a sentence.</p>
<h3 id="style-usage">Style Usage</h3>
<p>Title Case and Sentence style are used as follows:</p>

<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="wording">Wording</h2>
<p>Some important Do´s and Don´ts, but never all rules</p>
<ul>
<li>Avoid using unnecessary technical jargon or system-oriented information. Use short and plain words whenever possible.</li>
<li>Use everyday words and avoid words you would not say to someone else in person.</li>
<li>Be precise. Use specific verbs and choose object names and labels that clearly communicate and differentiate what the object does.</li>
<li>Keep command text short without sacrificing clarity (no more than 2-4 words, no articels).</li>
<li>For similar situations consistent words and phrasing have to be used (Double-D rule: differences are difficult).</li>
<li>Use positive phrasing. Avoid the use of negatives and do not use double negatives.</li>
<li>Describe the consequent state, not the current state (e.g. Play / Pause button in a player).</li>
<li>Avoid fillers and standard phrases.</li>
<li>Avoid noun-adjective confusion. There might be confusion between adjective and noun.
  You hyphenate some combined words if they form an adjective, but not if they form a noun, for example single line is a noun whereas single-line in single-line editor is an adjective.</li>
<li>Avoid using vague or generic command names (e.g. OK vs. submit)</li>
<li>Use verbs for commands that initiate an action of submit information (e.g. print, sign in).</li>
<li>Use adjectives for commands that trigger a change in the state of the system / appearance of an element (reflect how the element will change, e.g. b = bold, i = italic in Word)</li>
<li>Include ellipses ("...") in command text to indicate when more information will be required (e.g. open ...)</li>
<li>Avoid using the camel and pascal notation to abbreviate terms (e.g. use "Option button" instead of "optionButton" or "OptionButton").</li>
<li>Avoid abbreviations: Abbreviations are often internally known but unknown to the user.
  Therefore, avoid abbreviations: If the space is limited, abbreviate the terms.
  Abbreviate the terms the way that the meaning is apparent. This means a word should only be abbreviated as much as necessary.
  Use tooltips to provide the long form of the abbreviation.</li>
<li>Abbreviate units of measurement when they are accompanied by a numeric value. Always place one space between a number and a unit.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section hidden="hidden" id="panel-phrasing-templates" role="tabpanel">
<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="phrasing-templates">Phrasing Templates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Avoid camel notation/pascal notation to abbreviate terms.</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct/incorrect Example</p>
<ul>
<li>When possible, state messages, that require a choice as questions that permit "Yes" or "No" as an answer.</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct example</p>
<ul>
<li>If a problem occurs try to state the problem, its cause (if possible) and offer direct support.</li>
<li>A problem may have one out of several possible reasons. In this case state the possible reasons, connected by "or".
  Allocate an individual line for each reason and each "or". Avoid mapping more than three reasons in one message.</li>
<li>Keep the view of the customer in mind: Compose messages as specific as possible. E.g. in message boxes the user isn't interested in a description of the technical reason for the problem but in a solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Correct/incorrect Example</p>
<ul>
<li>The information given should be as short, though complete as possible. Give only necessary background information.
  Especially in message box message texts should not exceed two to three lines.
  If there are still details missing provide a help button that opens a help window.</li>
</ul>
<p>Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to <perform action>?</li>
<li>Are you sure you want to <perform action>?</li>
<li>Do you want to continue to <perform action>?</li>
<li>Do you want to save the changes to the current project?</li>
