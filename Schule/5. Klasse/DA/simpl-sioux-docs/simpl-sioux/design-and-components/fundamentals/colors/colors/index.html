<p>The SiOUX design system provides a light and a dark theme.
Each of the themes consists of the following color categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>Primary color palette</li>
<li>Accent color palette</li>
<li>Functional colors</li>
<li>Supporting colors</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="primary-color-palette">Primary Color Palette</h2>
<p>The primary colors are used throughout the complete app.</p>
<h2 id="accent-color-palette">Accent Color Palette</h2>
<p>The accent color is used rarely, especially to give attention to specific user interface elements.</p>
<h2 id="functional-colors">Functional Colors</h2>
<p>The functional colors are used to present status information. They are identical for both themes except the functional gray.
You can retrieve the functional colors by means of the following function: </br></p>
<p>get-functional-colors($theme)</p>
<p>The following functional colors are defined:</p>
<table>

<h2 id="dark-theme-vs-light-theme">Dark Theme vs. Light Theme</h2>
<p>The choice of the theme can be influenced by many points such as the usability, the business goals, the current design trends, the target audience and more.
If the target audience are mainly young people, a dark user interface seems to be more attractive, while middle-aged and older people prefer light color themes.</p>
<p>From usability point of view the decision should not be due to pure aesthetic reasons. Instead the decision should depend on the customer and his working conditions.
The following aspects can support you in your decision:</p>
<h3 id="readability-and-amount-of-usage">Readability and Amount of Usage</h3>
<p>In general, black text on white background which is used in SiOUX Light Theme is the most readable. Nevertheless,
it can fatigue the eyes if an application is used for a long time.
For this reason, interfaces which are used intensively and provide a lot of text should use a light text on
a dark background which is the case for the SiOUX Dark Theme. This is almost as readable, but less tiring.</p>
<h3 id="user-environment-and-time-of-use">User Environment and Time of Use</h3>
<p>Regarding this criteria it is relevant in which room the application is used and during which time of the
day. Dark interfaces are ideal during night time or in the evening, while light interfaces are more suitable
during daytime.
Applications which are used throughout the entire day should provide switchable themes where the customer
can decide which theme to use.</p>
<h3 id="use-when-sioux-light-theme">Use When SiOUX Light Theme</h3>
<p>1) The application is mainly used during day time in a bright environment </br>
2) The application is used for a short time and not extensively </br>
3) A lot of text is presented which requires a good readability </br>
4) The target audience are mainly middle-aged or older people</p>
<h3 id="use-when-sioux-dark-theme">Use When SiOUX Dark Theme</h3>
<p>1) The application is mainly used in the evening or in a dark environment </br>
2) The application is used extensively </br>
3) The target audience are young people</p>

<h2 id="primary-color-palette_1">Primary Color-Palette</h2>
<p>The primary color-palette of the dark theme is the following: <br><br>
<img alt="alt text" src="../pics/primary-color-dark-vertically.png" title="Primary color-palette" /></p>
<p>The 500 value is the primary color. This one is used for instance for primary buttons as well as text fields.</p>
<h2 id="accent-color-palette_1">Accent Color-Palette</h2>
<p>The accent color-palette of the dark theme is the following: <br><br>
<img alt="alt text" src="../pics/accent-color-dark-vertically.png" title="Accent color-palette" /></p>
<p>The 500 value is the primary color.</p>
<h2 id="warning-color-palette">Warning Color-Palette</h2>
<p>The warning color-palette of the dark theme is the following: <br><br>
<img alt="alt text" src="../pics/warning-color-dark-vertically.png" title="Warning color-palette" /></p>
<p>The 500 value is the primary color.</p>
<h2 id="base-color">Base Color</h2>
<p>As the elevations in the dark theme are shades of gray the dark theme consists additionally to the other
four color categories of a base color.
The base color of the SiOUX dark theme is “#11151E”. This is a dark gray which has been defined on base of the
by Google Material Design recommended surface color #121212 and an 8% overlay witd its 700 tone of the
accent color. Google Material Design suggests to use the accent color instead. Just as our accent color is
quite light we used the 700 tone value to receive a darker base color. <br><br>
