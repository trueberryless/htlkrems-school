<p>A navigation drawer is used for navigating to other screens and provides additional functionality as app settings
and the switch between dark and light theme.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../pics/navigation-drawer-light.png" title="Navigation Drawer - light theme" /> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
<img alt="alt text" src="../pics/navigation-drawer-dark.png" title="Navigation Drawer - dark theme" /></p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>This navigation tool visualizes a hierarchically structured set of elements. It is used as a navigation tool to
 locate individual elements based on their logical hierarchical relationship. The trees are flexible enough to
 represent even a large number of objects in multiple hierarchy levels.</p>
<h4 id="use-when">Use When</h4>
<ul>
<li>a hierarchy of destination items is represented, with two or more levels</li>
<li>a list of five or more (even unrelated) top level destination items is provided</li>
<li>there are application global settings like theme switch oder language toggle</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="use-alternatively">Use Alternatively</h4>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../tabs/tabs/index.html">tabs</a> for navigation between groups of content that are related and at the same level of hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h3>
<ul>
<li>A sheet containing a list</li>
<li>A list of items representing destinations or actions, optionally grouped by horizontal dividers (full width of drawer), if the content is long</li>
<li>An optional header area at the top of the list for brand expression (such as an app title or logo), an account
  switcher, and more</li>
<li>The list can contain expandable tree elements to represent a navigation hierarchy:<ul>
<li>the relative position of elements within the hierarchy helps users locate them easily</li>
<li>it is useful to be able to alter the amount of hierarchical detail displayed by expanding and collapsing
  the tree branches</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Each list item describing its meaning using a text label and optional icon (placed before text)</li>
<li>For label definition see <a href="../../../fundamentals/texts/texts/index.html">Wording</a>.</li>
<li>Tooltips to make text labels readable when they do not fit the available space without scrolling</li>
<li>A scrim block is used directly below the drawer´s sheet, if the navigation drawer is modal to block interaction
  with the rest of the app</li>
<li>In case of navigation tree a <a href="../../breadcrumb/breadcrumb/index.html">breadcrumb</a> must be provided additionally</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="placement">Placement</h3>
<ul>
<li>Locate the navigation drawer on the left side (on the opposite side of a <a href="../../side-sheet/side-sheet/index.html">side sheet</a>),</li>
<li>if the app is set to a left-to-right language, or the right side (for right-to-left language)</li>
<li>If there is a bottom app bar, it can also be located at the bottom and be opened from there (for use on
  mobile only)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>
<ul>
<li>The standard navigation drawer is either permanently on-screen or opened/closed by a navigation menu icon
  in the <a href="../../toolbar/toolbar/index.html">toolbar</a>
  or a specific control handle, represented by an arrow icon
  At a defined minimum breakpoint of at least 600dp width,
  a standard drawer should be replaced with a modal
  drawer (responsive layout)</li>
<li>A modal navigation drawer is closed by tapping/clicking outside the sheet</li>
<li>The list can be vertically scrolled (within the drawer without impact on the screen´s content) when the
  list content extends the drawer´s height</li>
</ul>
