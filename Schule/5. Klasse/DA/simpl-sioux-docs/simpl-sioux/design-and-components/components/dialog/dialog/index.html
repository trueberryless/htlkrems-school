<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Container</strong> - information is displayed in a rectangular, solidely colored container, extending the full
  width of a layout, in front of the temporarily scrimmed background (to indicate, that the dialog is modal
  and therefore not accessible as long as the dialog is shown)</li>
<li><strong>Title (optional)</strong> (left aligned) - brief and concise text label in active mode describing the dialog´s
  purpose (simple dialog), a statement (alert dialog) or a question (confirmation dialog)</li>
<li><strong>Detail text</strong> (left aligned)</li>
<li><strong>Actions</strong> - <a href="../../button/button/index.html">buttons</a> arranged side by side at the bottom of the container: Confirming
  actions are placed on the right side, dismissive ones to the left of a confirming one</li>
<li><strong>Icon</strong> - an icon (see <a href="../../../fundamentals/iconography/iconography/index.html">iconography</a> can illustrate the message optionally (i.e. warning / alarm / error).</li>
<li>For text definition see <a href="../../../fundamentals/texts/texts/index.html">Wording</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="placement">Placement</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dialogs retain focus until dismissed or an action has been taken, such as choosing a setting. They shouldn’t be
  obscured by other elements or appear partially on screen, with the exception of full-screen dialogs.</li>
<li>Usually placed in the center of the screen</li>
<li>If the click on an element has evoked the dialog, the dialog should be close to this icon and touch it at some point</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>As dialogs appear without warning, interrupting user´s work, they should be used sparingly</li>
<li>Full-screen dialogs are shown (only in Mobile scenario), when<ul>
<li>components are contained which require keyboard input, such as <a href="../../text-field/text-field/index.html">text fields</a></li>
<li>when changes aren’t saved instantly</li>
<li>when components within the dialog open additional dialogs</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scrolling should be avoided. When necessary the title as well as buttons are pinned and the content in between is scrollable.</li>
<li>Dismissing a dialog is done by<ul>
<li>interacting with the background</li>
<li>triggering the 'Cancel' button</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a close button is provided it must generally have the same effect as the 'Cancel' button at the bottom of
  the dialog</li>
<li>After having closed the dialog, the user is in the same context as before having opened the dialog window</li>
</ul>
