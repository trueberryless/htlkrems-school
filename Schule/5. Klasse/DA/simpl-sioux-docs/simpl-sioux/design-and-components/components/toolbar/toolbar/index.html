<p>The toolbar represents the application and provides information and actions.</p>
<p><img alt="Toolbar - light theme" src="../pics/toolbar-adobe-light.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="Toolbar - dark theme" src="../pics/toolbar-adobe-dark.png" /></p>
<h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>
<p>The toolbar reflects the branding as well as the purpose of the view through its title. Furthermore, it
provides actions and can hold a breadcrumb to support navigation. Therefore, it is an important component,
which should be provided with every app.
It can transform into a contextual action bar(see 'Behavior').</p>
<h3 id="use-when">Use When</h3>
<ul>
<li>frequently used commands and actions shall be provided being permanently displayed for quick access</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="use-alternatively">Use Alternatively</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../button/button/index.html">buttons</a> in the particular views for actions and commands, which are applicable only in these views</li>
<li><a href="../../drop-down-menu/drop-down-menu/index.html">drop down menus</a> in case there are many commands and actions</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="anatomy">Anatomy</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bar</strong> - a rectangular, solidely colored container, extending the full width of the layout, displaying elements like icon, action items, title.
The container can be vertically extended from regular size to a larger one to make it more prominent - usually reserved for promotional applications.</li>
<li><strong>Navigation icon (optional)</strong> - optionally an icon displayed on the left of the bar representing either<ul>
<li>a <a href="../../drop-down-menu/drop-down-menu/index.html">drop-down-menu</a> with global actions ("Hamburger Menu")</li>
<li>a button (back arrow) for returning to the previous view</li>
<li>a button (up arrow) for navigating upwards in the app´s hierarchy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Screen Title</strong> -  is placed on the right hand of the navigation icon and  used to show either<ul>
<li>application title</li>
<li>title of the view, which is currently shown</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Titles are normally left aligned. This can vary depending on the OS (mobile, tablet). For title definition
  see <a href="../../../fundamentals/texts/texts/index.html">Wording</a>. If the title is too long, it must not be truncated,
  but can be wrapped, supposed it is placed on a vertically enlarged ("prominent") bar.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Actions (optional)</strong> -  one or more context related action items represented as <a href="../../button/button/index.html">buttons</a> that help work on a process performed by the application.
Placed on the right end of the bar, sorted by their relevance / frequence of use (most used action on the left). Action items move to the <a href="../../drop-down-menu/drop-down-menu/index.html">overflow menu</a>
on the right end of the bar, if there is not sufficient place for them(less used items first).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="placement">Placement</h2>
<p>The toolbar is usually placed on the top of the screen.</p>
<h2 id="behavior">Behavior</h2>
<ul>
<li>An top app bar can change to a contextual action bar (color change) as soon as one element in the view below has been selected. It shows<ul>
<li>a close icon,</li>
<li>the number of selected items,</li>
<li>actions, applicable for the selection and</li>
<li>an overflow menu, if necessary.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The contextual action bar remains active until an action is taken or it is dismissed and will transform back to the top app bar afterthat (color change).
- Scrolling up in the view below the app bar
    - hides the bar or
    - reduces an enlarged ("prominent") bar to a regular one.</p>
<p>Scrolling down will show the bar in full size.
- Resizing the screen has a direct impact on the app bar, which will resize with it. Depending on the resulting space, actions are shown on the bar or in the overflow menu.</p>

<p>The two icons 'toggle theme' and 'select a specific theme' are not visible per default. They can be enabled by adding the following to the html-representation of the toolbar:
[showPickerIcon]="showPickerIcon" [showPickerMenu]="showPickerMenu" and setting those values accordingly to true (refer to the code sample above).</p>
<p>The following basic implementation can be used to apply Sioux toolbar:</p>

<h2 id="user-defined-iconic-buttons">User Defined Iconic Buttons</h2>
<p>The SiOUX toolbar provides the possibility to add user defined iconic buttons to the toolbar.
They can be either of the standard toolbar icon color or of accent color.
To use them, you need to define and initialize them within your class:</p>

<h2 id="theme-switch">Theme Switch</h2>
<p>If you want to implement a theme switch within your application you first of all need to generate your application based style files.
This can be done with the following commands within the "scripts" section of your package.json file:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span><span class="nt">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="linenos" data-linenos="3 "></span>    <span class="nt">&quot;theme:build:light&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sass --load-path=node_modules src/assets/themes/sioux-light-theme.scss src/assets/themes/angular/sioux-light-theme.css&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="4 "></span>    <span class="nt">&quot;theme:build:dark&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;sass --load-path=node_modules src/assets/themes/sioux-dark-theme.scss src/assets/themes/angular/sioux-dark-theme.css&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="5 "></span>    <span class="nt">&quot;start&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;npm run theme:build:light &amp;&amp; npm run theme:build:dark &amp;&amp; ng build &amp;&amp; ng serve&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

<span class="linenos" data-linenos="8 "></span>    <span class="nt">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;ng test&quot;</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="9 "></span>  <span class="p">},</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Additionally you need to adapt the "styles" sections of your angular.json file accordingly:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span> <span class="nt">&quot;styles&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="p">[</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="2 "></span>              <span class="s2">&quot;src/styles.scss&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="3 "></span>              <span class="s2">&quot;src/assets/themes/angular/sioux-light-theme.css&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="4 "></span>              <span class="s2">&quot;src/assets/themes/angular/sioux-dark-theme.css&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="5 "></span>              <span class="s2">&quot;node_modules/@simpl/sioux-theme/fonts/theme-fonts.css&quot;</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="6 "></span>            <span class="p">],</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Add to your styles.scss file the following:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span><span class="k">@use</span> <span class="s1">&#39;./assets/themes/angular/sioux-dark-theme.css&#39;</span> <span class="nt">as</span> <span class="nt">dark</span><span class="o">;</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Additionally to the automatically generated css-files you need to include the following two scss-files to your asset/themes folder:</p>
<ul>
<li>sioux-dark-theme.scss</li>
<li>sioux-light-theme.scss</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../pics/structure-theme-folder.png" title="Additional Scss files" /></p>

<h2 id="component-specific-styling">Component specific styling</h2>
<p>If you need component specific styling, the best is to add a component specific theme file which contains your mixins:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../pics/component-specific-styling.png" title="Component specific styling" /></p>
<p>Here is a sample content of button specific styling which uses Sioux specific colors:</p>

<p>If you need to retrieve the sioux <a href="../../../fundamentals/colors/colors/index.html">functional colors</a>
or the sioux supporting colors <a href="../../../fundamentals/colors/colors/index.html">supporting colors</a> you need to use the theming node file as in the sample above and then you can access it as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span><span class="nv">$functionalColors</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="n">node</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="nf">get-functional-colors</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">$theme</span><span class="p">);</span>

<p>The resulting array can then be utilized by means of map.get.</p>
<p>If you want to access the theme palette colors, you can achieve this as follows:</p>
