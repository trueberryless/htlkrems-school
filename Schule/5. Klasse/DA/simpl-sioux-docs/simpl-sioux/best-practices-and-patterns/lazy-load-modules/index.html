<p>Each Feature Module that will not be needed for the bootstrap an starting an App should be loadable by manual
lazy loading. See also: <a href="https://dev.to/binarysort/manually-lazy-load-components-in-angular-8-ffi">https://dev.to/binarysort/manually-lazy-load-components-in-angular-8-ffi</a></p>
<p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
<p>Single-page applications tend to be fast once loaded but initial loading time often suffers. This is because of a
huge amount of javascript that needs to be downloaded and interpreted by the browser to boot up the Javascript app.
To deal with this we need to reduce the size of the main javascript bundle necessary to boot the app (for angular
apps <em>main.js</em>). This can be achieved with lazy loading. We don't load unused bits (modules) and load them on demand.</p>
<p><strong>What is Lazy Loading?</strong></p>
<p>Lazy loading or "On-demand loading" is a programming practice where we delay the loading of an object until its
needed. In simple terms, you put off doing something which is not required now.
For example, we have settings area in our app which users rarely visit. Until necessary, we do not want
to load the JavaScript corresponding to the settings area. At the latest, when the user clicks on the
corresponding menu item,
we can fetch the Javascript file (module) and load up that section of our app.
For this to work, our compiled code for that settings area must be isolated in a dedicated Javascript file, so that
we can fetch it at runtime when needed. This sounds complex. Thankfully, Angular provides this func-tionality
and does all the file bundling for us.</p>
<h2 id="way-1-lazy-load-modules-via-routes">Way 1 - Lazy-load modules via routes</h2>
<p>In Angular, the most basic unit is a module. A module is a mechanism to group components, directives,
pipes andservices that are related. So, modules are necessary for Angular to know which dependencies are
required and which components are used in the template. Therefore, <strong>the most basic unit that can be
lazy-loaded in Angular is a</strong>module**, and with the module come the bundled components that we are
interested in.</p>
<p>The easiest way to lazy-load modules is via routes:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span><span class="kd">const</span> <span class="nx">routes</span>: <span class="kt">Routes</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span>

<span class="linenos" data-linenos="5 "></span><span class="p">];</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <em>loadChildren</em> property takes a function that returns a promise using the browser's built-in syntax for lazy
loading code using dynamic imports <em>import('...')</em>.</p>
<p>But we want more control over lazy loading, and not just with routes. We want to open a dialog, and lazy load its containing component just when a user opens that specific dialog.</p>
<h2 id="way-2-manual-lazy-loading-of-modules">Way 2 – Manual Lazy-loading of modules</h2>
<p>Since Angular 8 the browser's built-in dynamic imports import('...') is used:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Dynamic import() introduces a new function-like form of import that caters to those use cases. import
(moduleSpecifier) returns a promise for the module namespace ob-ject of the requested module, which is created
after fetching, instantiating, and evaluating all of the module’s dependencies, as well as the module itself.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In simple terms, dynamic <em>import()</em> enables async loading of JS Modules. So, we don't have to worry about
creating a dedicated JS bundle for our module, dynamic <em>import()</em> feature will take care of it.</p>
<p>First define an <em>entry</em> property to the start component in the module that should be lazy-loaded.</p>

<p><em>export const lazyWidgets</em> will create a dedicated JS bundle for a lazy module. Each module that should be
lazy loadable must be defined here with own <em>path</em> element.
The function <em>lazyArrayToObj()</em> will work as a factory for injecting lazy widget array in the main module.
It is a helper function. Additionally we define the injection token to inject lazy widgets in the service by an
own file named <em>tokens.ts</em>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span><span class="k">import</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">InjectionToken</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="kr">from</span> <span class="s1">&#39;@angular/core&#39;</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>The third step is to define the hard of the manual lazy loading process by defining it in an own file named
<em>lazy-loader.service.ts</em>.</p>
<p>LazyLoaderService loads the module with dynamic <em>import()</em>. If it's compiled ahead of time then we just take it as
it is. If we are using <em>JIT</em> mode we have to compile it. After, we inject all the dependencies in the module.</p>
