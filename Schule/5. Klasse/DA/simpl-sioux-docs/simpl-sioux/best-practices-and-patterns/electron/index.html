<p>The <em>SiOUX</em> framework provides the possibility to run <em>WEB Apps</em> as <em>Native Apps</em>. That means the WEB apps has the functionality as a native app like have access to the local file system and more.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../electron1.png" title="From WEB to Native App" /></p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../electron2.png" title="The Electron Framework" /></p>
<p>With Electron, it’s easy to deploy your application to the desktop, but it’s still a single page application.
Electron is a framework for cross-platform desktop applications using Chromium and Node.js. Other in-built
features are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Automatic updates</strong> — enable apps to automatically update themselves</li>
<li><strong>Native menus and notifications</strong> — creates native application menus and context menus</li>
<li><strong>App crash reporting</strong> — you can submit crash reports to a remote server</li>
<li><strong>Debugging and profiling</strong> — Chromium’s content module finds performance bottlenecks and slow operations. You
  can also use your favorite Chrome Developer Tools within your app.</li>
<li><strong>Windows installer</strong> — you can create install packages. Fast and simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>We added the start:electron script which runs the ng build --base-href ./ &amp;&amp; electron . command:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ng build --base-href ./ part of the command builds the Angular app and sets the base href to ./.</li>
<li>The electron . part of the command starts our Electron app from the current directory.
Now, in your terminal, run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>npm run start:electron</code></p>
<p>An Electron GUI window will be opened, but will be blank. In the console, you’ll see the Not allowed to load
local <em>resource: /electron-angular-demo/dist/index.html</em> error.
Electron is unable to load the file from the dist folder because it simply doesn’t exist. If you look in your
project’s folder, you’ll see that Angular CLI builds your app in the dist/electron-angular-demo folder instead
of just the dist folder.
In our <em>main.js</em> file, we are telling Electron to look for the <em>index.html</em> file in the dist folder without a
sub-folder:</p>

<p><em>__dirname</em> refers to the current folder from which we’re running Electron.
We use the path.join() method to join the path of the current folder with the <em>/dist/index.html</em> path.
You can either change the second part of the path to <em>/dist/electron-angular-demo/index.html</em> or, better yet,
change the Angular configuration to output the files in the dist folder without using a subfolder.
Open the angular.json file, locate the projects → architect → build → options → outputPath key and change its
value from dist/electron-angular-demo to just dist:</p>

<p>Head back to your terminal and again run the following command:</p>
<p><code>npm run start:electron</code></p>
<p>The script will call the ng build command to build the Angular app in the dist folder, and call electron from
the current folder to start the Electron window with the Angular app loaded.
This is a screenshot of our desktop app running Angular:</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../electron3.png" title="Native App" /></p>
<h2 id="calling-electron-apis-from-angular">Calling Electron APIs from Angular</h2>
<p>Let’s now see how we can call Electron APIs from Angular.
Electron apps make use of a main process running <em>Node.js</em> and a renderer process running the Chromium browser.
We can’t directly access all of Electron’s APIs from the Angular app.</p>
<p>We need to make use of IPC or Inter-Process Communication, which is a mechanism provided by operating systems
to allow communication between different processes.
Not all Electron APIs need to be accessed from the main process. Some APIs can be accessed from the renderer
process, and some APIs can be accessed from both the main and renderer processes.</p>
<p>BrowserWindow, which is used to create and control browser windows, is only available in the main process.
The <em>desktopCapturer</em> API (used for capturing audio and video from the desktop using the
<em>navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia</em> API) is only available in the renderer process. Meanwhile the clipboard
API (for performing copy and paste operations on the system clipboard) is available on both the main and
renderer processes.
You can see the complete list of APIs from the official docs.</p>
<p>Let’s see an example of calling the BrowserWindow API, available only in the main process, from the
Angular app.
Open the main.js file and import <em>ipcMain</em>:</p>
<p><code>const {app, BrowserWindow, ipcMain} = require('electron')</code></p>
<p>Next, define the openModal() function:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span>    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">openModal</span><span class="p">(){</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="2 "></span>      <span class="kd">const</span> <span class="p">{</span> <span class="nx">BrowserWindow</span> <span class="p">}</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;electron&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="linenos" data-linenos="8 "></span>    <span class="p">}</span>

<p>This method will create a child modal window, load the <em><a href="https://www.sitepoint.com*">https://www.sitepoint.com*</a> URL inside it, and display
it when it’s ready.
Next, listen for an </em>openModal<em> message that will be sent from the renderer process and call the </em>openModal()*
function when the message is received:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span>    <span class="nx">ipcMain</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">on</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;openModal&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">event</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">arg</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">=&gt;</span> <span class="p">{</span>

<span class="linenos" data-linenos="3 "></span>    <span class="p">})</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, open the <em>src/app/app.component.ts</em> file and add the following import:</p>
<p><code>import { IpcRenderer } from 'electron';</code></p>
<p>Next, define an ipc variable and call <em>require('electron').ipcRenderer</em> to import ipcRenderer in your Angular
component:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos=" 1 "></span>      <span class="k">private</span> <span class="nx">ipc</span>: <span class="kt">IpcRenderer</span>

<span class="linenos" data-linenos="11 "></span>        <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="12 "></span>      <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <em>require()</em> method is injected at runtime in the renderer process by Electron and as such, it will only
be available when running your web application in Electron.
Finally, add the following <em>openModal()</em> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span>      <span class="nx">openModal</span><span class="p">(){</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="2 "></span>        <span class="nx">console</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">log</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Open a modal&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="3 "></span>        <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">ipc</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">send</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;openModal&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="4 "></span>      <span class="p">}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>We use the <em>send()</em> method of ipcRenderer to send an openModal message to the main process.
Open the <em>src/app/app.component.html</em> file and add a button, then bind it to the <em>openModal()</em> method:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code><span class="linenos" data-linenos="1 "></span>    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="nx">button</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">click</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;openModal()&quot;</span><span class="o">&gt;</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="2 "></span>      <span class="nx">Open</span> <span class="nx">Modal</span>
<span class="linenos" data-linenos="3 "></span>    <span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="err">/button&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, run your desktop app using the following command:</p>
<p><code>npm run start:electron</code></p>
