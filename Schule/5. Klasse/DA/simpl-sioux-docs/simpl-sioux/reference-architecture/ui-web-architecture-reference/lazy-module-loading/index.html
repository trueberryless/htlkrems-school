<p>One of the most visible performance problems that users may encounter is the loading time of the applica-tion.
As the codebase gets bigger, the size of the application bundle increases as well. The bigger the bun-dle, the
longer it takes for the browser to load and parse the source code.</p>
<p>There are multiple ways in which we can reduce the size of the application bundle, however, those are not
within the subject matter of this article. Additionally, sooner or later, despite all efforts, the bundle
will be big enough to cause visible delay in the application’s start.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../lazy-loading1.png" title="Not Lazy Module Loading" /></p>
<p>Fortunately, there is a pattern that is aimed to solve the loading time issue, that is <strong>lazy loading</strong>.
It allows to defer the loading of a part of the application until it's needed (usually when the user wants to
access a screen of the application).</p>
<p>Angular comes with a built-in Lazy Loading capability, you just have to properly define the module route definition,
so that it points to a module file that will be <em>lazy-loaded</em>.</p>
<p>If you followed the previously described project structure, your feature modules can now all be lazy loaded on
demand, after the application is initialized. This vastly reduces the initialization time of the application,
improvingoverall user experience. What is more, this solution scales with the application. When the application
grows and more lazy loaded modules are added, the application core bundle and, therefore, its starting time remain
the same.</p>
<p><img alt="alt text" src="../lazy-loading2.png" title="Lazy Module Loading" /></p>
<p>If a default, load on demand approach is not enough, it's possible to define so-called preloading strategies that can be used to customize how the modules are loaded in each application.</p>
