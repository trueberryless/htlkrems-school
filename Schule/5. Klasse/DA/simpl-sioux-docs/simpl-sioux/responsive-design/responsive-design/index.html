</div>
<section id="panel-details" role="tabpanel">
<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="details">Details</h2>
<p>If you are implementing a responsive application which supports several devices and screen sizes the Sioux Dynamic Layout will be the right for you.
Instead of tweaking the existing frontend implementation via css, you can implement for each screen resolution a different view.</p>
<p>Like this You are not required to use for each screen size the same controls but
you can choose those controls which support our customers the best on the corresponding device.</p>
<p>For instance the view on desktop mode could show a table:</p>
<p><img alt="Desktop" src="../pics/dynamic-layout-desktop.png" /></p>
<p>On a tablet it could show a one-line table without header:</p>
<p><img alt="Tablet" src="../pics/dynamic-layout-tablet.png" /></p>
<p>And on a mobile phone it could show several cards:</p>
<p><img alt="Mobile" src="../pics/dynamic-layout-mobile.png" /></p>
<p>The data from the backend is transmitted from the backend via a façade to the different views. So the data access needs to be implemented only once.</p>
<p><img alt="Architecture" src="../pics/dynamic-layout-architecture.png" /></p>
</section>
<section hidden="hidden" id="panel-code" role="tabpanel">
<h2 class="tab-anchor" id="code">Code</h2>
<p>Our proposed source code structure for each application view which should be made responsive is the following:</p>
<p><img alt="Source Code Structure" src="../pics/source-code-structure.png" /></p>
<h3 id="dynamictablecomponent">DynamicTableComponent</h3>
<p>This component needs to be used in the routing or in the page where the views shall be displayed. It contains an array of SiouxDynViewItems which ensure the usage of the correct views.</p>
